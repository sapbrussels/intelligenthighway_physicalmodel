# The Arduino source code

In this code we use a protothreading library that allow to run two task simultaniously.

In the first thread we turn an LED on when the sensors is activated, and the second one drives the motors.

The library used are the following : 

* pt.h ( for protothreading )
* stepper.h ( for the motors )
